# There is simply just too much information

             And you can't handle it! Also, you shouldn't.

In the process of understanding how to get a job in the tech field, I have faced myself doing a huge mistake:  
> I was drowing in a ocean on information, and trying to grasp it all  

First of all, in the tech field there's a lot of technologies and new ones are emerging everyday. When you try to learn them all, you have the feeling of enter in a overwhelming situation and end up not learning nothing at all. But that's common in all fields of knowledge, the excitement to learn different fields without establishing the foundation. However in this tech world, there is a dangerous aggravant: _the online courses_.  
Thoses, give you the false sensation of productivity and that you're learning efficiently the contents of it. To worse the situation, these courses are being released at a very fast pace. Their advertise, contains the most exciting topics that makes you want to enroll in multiples courses at the same time. The inclusion of certificates to everyone who finishes it, increases that false sensation of evolution. Different than it looks, **they don't mean nothing!**  
Online courses, in their majority, are very easy to follow and to accomplish it with an excelent grade. So, if anyone can get it easily it does not have any value. However that doesnt mean that they are pure garbage. Actually, they are a good *INTRODUCTION* to the topic, to make you have a general notion of it. **But that's all**. What really matter after finishing one of thoses, it's to put this introductory knowledge in practice and make something useful of it. Unfortunately, that was the opposite of what I have been doing. I have collected dozens of certificates that doesn't mean absolutely nothing, because I did not make nothing useful of them. I just did it and thought that it was sufficient. So I ditched all the online courses I was enrolled and sticked to the fundamentals, not new and exciting technologies that keep changing everyday, but to the pure fundamentals. Which include mathematics, statistics, algorithms, data structures...

But that's just one single example. There is too much information everywhere
