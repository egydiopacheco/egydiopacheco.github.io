# Bitwise in coding

Today I started a challenge in [__*LeetCode*__](https://leetcode.com/), and it's first problem was:  given a non empty array of integers, return the element that do not repeat itself. Also was asked to the program have linear runtime complexity.

Firstly I solved it with a lot of nested for and ifs, which lead me to pass the case but it does not rank me in a good position, based on performance.

But then I tought about the *bitwise operators*, which are fast methods of operations since it "operates at the processor level". For those who dont know about bitwise operators, I made a simple image to explain it in a very superficial level.

Those operator works on the bit level, and do operations like those in the image. For example:  
$$
 81 \&  13 = 1.
$$ 
And why is that?


First you translate 81 and 13 in binary mode:
$$
81 \longrightarrow 01010010   
$$
$$
13 \longrightarrow 00001101
$$

Now every operator has its *Truth Table*, its rules of operation, for __&__ operator the only way to get 1's is by having 1 in both binary digits, like we see in the image. The following is the truth table of AND:

| Digit 1 | Digit  2 | Result |
| -----   | -------- | -------| 
|   0     |    0     |    0   |
|   1     |    0     |    0   |
|   0     |    1     |    0   |
|   1     |    1     |    1   |

After that I rewrite my code using them:  
~~~Java
class Solution {
    public int singleNumber(int[] nums) {
        int awnser = 0;
        
        for(int x : nums){
            awnser = awnser ^ x; //Bitwise operator;
        }
        return awnser;
    }
}

~~~

 It solves the problem in very few lines of code and made the performance to rise a lot in terms of Runtime Distribution:

  and in terms of Memory Distribution it is placed on the 15% first.

Bitwise is something that I never thought about using in practical coding. I always think about it as something abstract and low-level that I would never use. I'm glady wrong, and make me think about to leave a bit from the high level programming and start understand more how really computers work at low level.
