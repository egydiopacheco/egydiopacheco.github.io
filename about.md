title: About Me
---

I am a polymath!

Which means I love learning about mostly everything, ranging from linguistics to real analysis. Then gather these diverse knowledge and build something unique. At the momment I am getting deep on learning Computer Science and making it my main tool of building knowledge.  

I want to work with Machine Learning and apply it to very fuzzy fields, like neuroscience, economics or cybersecurity.
I am also a huge fan of Complexity Science and dynamical systems, and have done several courses in this field on Santa Fe Institute.
